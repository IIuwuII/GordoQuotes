# Gordo Quotes
Gordo Quotes *(codename KetoBot)* is a Discord bot written fully on Python that quotes many members from the [iOS Jailbreak Discord Server](https://discord.me/iosjb). 

### Getting Started
If you'd like to use this bot for your server, clone this repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads):

    git clone https://github.com/xstecky/Keto-Bot.git
    
After, create a file on the root of the project named ``config.py``, and add the following content:

    token =  'token' // refers to your unique Discord Bot token you must generate
    prefix =  ';' // refers to the prefix the bot uses for commands
    
Finally, run the bot on your computer and invite the bot to your Discord server. Once the bot has joined your Discord server, run ``;help`` to generate a list of commands the bot offers.
