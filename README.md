### Getting Started
In order to get started with KetoBot, you first must edit `config.py` before starting the bot. Things included in said file are your bot token and the prefix you prefer (KetoBot will always use the prefix `;` unless one is specified). 

Below is an example of how the file should look like. Once `config,py` is configured correctly, you can start the bot.
```
token = 'TOKEN'
prefix = 'PREFIX'
```
